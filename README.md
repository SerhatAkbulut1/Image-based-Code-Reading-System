# Image-based-Code-Reading-System

## Introduction

Welcome to your first assignment! This assignment is designed to familiarize you with C++ programming and basic data structures, particularly high-dimensional matrices. You will gain hands-on experience with classes, constructors, destructors, and various matrix operations. Additionally, you will implement these concepts for a basic image processing task, combining theoretical knowledge with real-world applications.

## Prerequisites

If youâ€™re unfamiliar with image processing, don't worry! We will guide you through the terminology and operations step by step. Here are a few key concepts you'll be delving into:

1. **Image Matrix Representation:** Grayscale and colored images are represented as matrices. Each element corresponds to the intensity of a pixel, ranging from 0 (black) to 255 (white).

2. **Convolution:** A mathematical operation used in image processing to modify image appearance by applying a filter (kernel). Convolution involves sliding the kernel over the image, multiplying neighboring pixels by corresponding kernel values, and summing the results.

3. **Sobel Operator:** A discrete differentiation operator used for edge detection. It involves convolving the image with two 3x3 kernels designed to respond maximally to vertical and horizontal edges.

4. **Image Sharpening:** An image enhancement technique involving subtracting a blurred image from the original and adding the result back to the original to highlight edges.

5. **Edge Detection:** A process of identifying edges in an image by calculating the gradient magnitude and thresholding the result.

## Your Quest

In this assignment, you'll embark on a quest to decode hidden messages concealed within celestial images. Your tasks involve:

1. **Image Processing:** Implementing algorithms for image sharpening, edge detection, and decoding hidden messages.
2. **Message Decoding and Encoding:** Deciphering hidden messages using LSB steganography and embedding updated messages back into the image.
3. **Class Implementation:** Developing classes to handle different aspects of image processing, including image loading, matrix operations, convolution, edge detection, and message encoding/decoding.

## Problem Statements and Classes

You'll be working with several classes to handle various tasks:

1. **ImageLoader:** Simplifies image loading from a specified path.
2. **ImageMatrix:** Encapsulates pixel data of an image and provides functionalities for matrix operations.
3. **Convolution:** Performs convolution operations on an image.
4. **ImageSharpening:** Applies a basic image sharpening algorithm to an input image.
5. **EdgeDetector:** Detects edges in an image using Sobel operators.
6. **DecodeMessage:** Decodes a binary string into its ASCII representation.
7. **EncodeMessage:** Embeds a binary message back into an image matrix.
8. **ImageProcessor:** Utilizes all classes to decode and encode hidden messages in images.

Please refer to the provided problem statements and class implementations for detailed instructions and specifications.
